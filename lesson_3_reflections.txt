When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

* You would want to use a remote repository when you are either working with many people or
* expect to work on multiple desktops. To add a remote use "git remote add 'link_to_github'"
* To check your remote use "git remote." To push commits to a remote use "git push remote_name
* branch_name."
