What happens when you initalize a repositiory? Why do you need it?

* A git repository is where all of your commits are saved. When you 
* run the code git init the repositiory is created but saved in a 
* hidden file. To see this file (or any hidden file) run the command
* ls -a. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?

* The staging area is where you choose what files to commit. You can 
* add files that you want to add. Once these files and a comment is 
* added the commit will be saved to the repository.
